# Identity and Access Management (IAM) – 35 Hour Comprehensive Program

## Course Overview
This course provides a complete foundation in Identity and Access Management (IAM), covering authentication, authorization, federation, identity governance, privileged access, Zero Trust, and cloud IAM concepts.

The program is vendor-neutral and designed for beginners, students, and working professionals entering the IAM domain.
